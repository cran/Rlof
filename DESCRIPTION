Description: R parallel implementation of Local Outlier Factor(LOF) which uses multiple CPUs to significantly speed up the LOF computation for large datasets. (Note: The overall performance depends on the computers especially the number of the cores).It also supports multiple k values to be calculated in parallel, as well as various distance measures in addition to the default Euclidean distance.
